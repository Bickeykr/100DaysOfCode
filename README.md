# Welcome to my 100DaysOfCode log.



- My name is Bickey kumar, I am doing all these learning and challenges to become a [Full Stack Web Developer](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp#:~:text=Full%20Stack%20Web,SQLite%2C%20or%20MongoDB) and this is a repo for Daily logs of 100DaysOfCode challenge.





 

  <details>
    <summary><b>You can check my 100DaysOfCode logs by clicking Log.md below </b></summary><br>

    - There may be two reasons why you may want to check [Log.md](Log.md) :-

        1. In case you are personally learning web development yourself then check it may be worth your while because I tried making it for someone like you worth reading.

        2. Somehow you came across this repo and want to see how I did my 100DaysOfCode challenge and logging stuff. I tried to keep it simple as inspired [MightyJoeW/100-Days-of-Code](https://github.com/MightyJoeW/100-Days-of-Code)

        3. Or maybe something else who knows either way you are "Welcome to my 100DaysOfCode log".
