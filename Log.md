Day 3: Thursday July, 21, 2022
</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 more challenge of the blog post website. It took me 4 hours of work to complete these 5 challenges, I think It's kinda slow but it's fine I had to google few concepts couple of times and go through documentations of it so, it's fine all that matters that I was there with it hunting for the solution.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes we feel lonely, so it's good to catch up with good old friends it really helps i did it yesterday myself we talked for 1hr40m to tell the truth he is having it rough now a days he had to stop his study due to financial problems and joined work for revenue and i tried to cheer his up. So, when ever you feel lonely try it, who knows it may work for you as well. <b>Thank you if you read this.</b>

Day 9: Wednesday July, 27, 2022
</h2>

**Today's Progress**: Learning mongoose, Today created a database connection, inserted docs basically performed CRUD MongoDB database using mongoose.

- here is a good one run the below code and check console what do I believe you are.

  <details>
  <summary><b>The code</b></summary>

  ```
  const mongoose = require("mongoose");

  main().catch((err) => console.log(err));

  async function main() {
    await mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/youGood");

    const youSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      discription: String,
    });

    const Person = mongoose.model("Person", youSchema);

    const you = new Person({
      discription:
        "You are the finest person i have ever encountered. @bickey_kr",
    });

    await you.save();

    Person.find(function (err, Person) {
      mongoose.connection.close();
      Person.forEach((item, i) => {
        console.log(i + ". " + item.discription);
      });
    });
  }

  }
  ```

  </details>

- If you decide to run the code make sure you have got the prerequisites ready to run the code (like installation of MongoDB and more).

**Thoughts:** I only studied for 2 hours today and I was supposed to do 5 hours but i don't regret it because when I was about to study my father called me for help in our shop. so I was there.
